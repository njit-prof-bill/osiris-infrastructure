  2. **Explore Docker SDK for Python**:
     - Install `Docker SDK for Python` using:  
       ```bash
       pip install docker
       ```

  3. **Implement the API Endpoint in FastAPI**:
     - Create a basic FastAPI project following a tutorial or the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
     - Write a simple route (e.g., `/api/run-container`) and verify it returns a basic response.
     - Use the `Docker SDK for Python` to integrate the `runDockerContainer` functionality within this route.
   
  4. **Testing**:
     - Test running a basic container (like `hello-world`) using the `runDockerContainer` API.
     - Experiment with different environment variables and port mappings to ensure the API parameters work as intended.
     - Implement error messages that provide clear feedback if stopping the container fails.
